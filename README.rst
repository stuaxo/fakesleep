fakesleep
=========

fakesleep is a simple module for tests that use `time.sleep()`. Sleeping in
tests is generally considered bad (as it makes tests run slow). Using
sleep with `time.time()` can lead to spurious failures, as clock
precision / interpeter overhead can cause small differences in reported
times.

But sometimes, you need `sleep()`.

fakesleep provides a fake implementation of `time.sleep()` that doesn't
actually sleep. It also guarrantees "correct" results for calls to
`time.time()` and other time functions. Note that `datetime` functions are
**not** faked.

To install, simply call `fakesleep.monkey_patch()`. To restore the real versions, call `fakesleep.monkey_restore()`.

A context manager is available that runs the monkeypatching and restoring for you:

>>> with fakesleep.fakesleep_context():
...    sleep(10)
...    # no time has has actually elapsed.
